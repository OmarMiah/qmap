## **Project Scope :**
#### Creating a website that will allow a student to view the most successful course path to graduating quickly
- Project will be divided into groups with a heavy focus on technical direction<br>
There will be 2 teams, Frontend and Backend
    - The Frontend team will be focusing on the web stack's frontend layer
        - They will be responsible for establishing the entire UX and UI experience of the website, with a strong focus on efficient deliverability and a quality experience
        - This will include managing a unified project management system, separate from the Backend teams' but related to the main project's goals as dictated by leads and director
    - The Backend team will be focusing on the entire backend stack of the application
        - They will be responsible for implementing the programmatic backbone of the application, with a strong focus on scalability and modularity to be efficient in integrating with the other layers
        - This will include managing a separate project management system as well as implementing the entire data layer
- The infrastructure layer of the project will be a shared responsibility between teams, with teams leads negotiating closely with team director on how it should be setup most appropriately for project needs
    - Both teams will work in the same repository while isolating their code using the MVC workflow style
    - The infrastructure layer will not have a direct team allocation and thusly will not have a project management system. It will be the responsibility of each team to negotiate needs on a case by case basis with leads and the director to have the infrastructure requirements handled
